# ‚òÄÔ∏è Hydrogen

<img alt="npm" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@hydrogen-design-system/hydrogen.css?color=%239d5cff&label=latest">

Hydrogen is a utility-first styling tool for creating web interfaces without writing CSS.

It leverages data-attributes to allow the styling of elements right in your markup, rather than creating your own classes. Hydrogen offers a comprehensive library of tools and configurations for easy, seamless development. When you're ready to publish your project, it then processes your markup and creates a custom CSS file that contains only the code you've used, reducing its own footprint.

[Visit the documentation website for details.](https://hydrogen.design)

# üõ†Ô∏è Basic Usage

- run `npm install @hydrogen-design-system/hydrogen.css` to install Hydrogen
- run `npx h2-init` to setup your input/output directories
- modify your `hydrogen.config.json` file to match your theme
- run `npx h2-watch` to watch your files for changes and compile when a change is detected
- run `npx h2-build` when you're ready to deploy to production

This repository also contains a handy `hydrogen.snippets.json` file that contains snippet automation for VS Code, enabling auto completion and tab stops.

# üèóÔ∏è Configuration

You can learn more about Hydrogen's configuration file on the [documentation website](https://hydrogen.design/#configuration).

Hydrogen is configured using a `hydrogen.config.json` file located at the root of your project. The `npx h2-init` script is designed to create this file for you and prompts for some required information before you can proceed.

Within this configuration file, you can modify many of Hydrogen's utilities to include values that suit your project's needs and theme, including custom media queries, colors, whitespace, and shadows.
