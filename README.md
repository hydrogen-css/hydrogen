# üåû Welcome to Hydrogen

Hydrogen is an open-source design and CSS utility framework powered by data-attributes.

By parsing the contents of custom `data-h2-` attributes, Hydrogen allows you to style elements completely from your markup. It comes equipped with a comprehensive library of tools and configurations for easy, seamless development. At runtime, it processes your markup and builds a CSS file that contains only the code you've used, preventing duplication and bloat.

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic usage

### Installation

- navigate to your project
- run `npm install @hydrogen-css/hydrogen` to install Hydrogen
- run `npx h2-init` to create a configuration file and set up your input/output directories
- modify your `hydrogen.config.json` file to match your theme
- add `data-h2` to your `<html>` element or parent wrapper
- run `npx h2-watch` to watch your files for changes and compile when a change is detected
- run `npx h2-build` when you're ready to deploy to production

### Syntax

Hydrogen uses a custom `data-attribute` syntax:

`data-h2-property="query:modifiers(options)"`

An example of a Hydrogen attribute in use looks something like this:

`data-h2-color="base(primary) base:hover(accent)"`

This repository also contains a handy `hydrogen.snippets.json` file that offers snippet automation for VS Code, enabling auto completion and tab stops so that you don't have to memorize options for every property.

## üèóÔ∏è Configuration

Hydrogen is configured using a `hydrogen.config.json` file located at the root of your project. The `npx h2-init` script is designed to create this file for you and prompts for some required information to get things working.

Within this configuration file, you can modify many of Hydrogen's options to include values that suit your project's needs and theme, including custom media queries, colors, typography, and shadows.

You can learn more about [configuring Hydrogen in the documentation](https://beta.hydrogen.design/en/docs/setup/configuration).

## ü§ñ Features

### Speed and compression

Hydrogen uses custom scripting to scan your code for `data-h2-` attributes and then builds a CSS stylesheet that contains only Hydrogen's core and the attributes you've used. No bloat. No duplication. This means that the library in production is concise while allowing it to provide a robust set of features and support complex customization.

It also runs Autoprefixer and CSSNano on itself to provide a complete, production ready file.

### Utilities

Hydrogen offers over 40 utility attributes and counting. Many replicate standard utility behaviour, while others offer convenient shortcuts that simplify what is normally complex CSS.

You can learn about [all available utility attributes in the documentation](https://beta.hydrogen.design/attributes).

### Queries and modifiers

The biggest advantage to Hydrogen's `data-attribute` syntax is that it enables the use of inline media queries, selectors, states, targeting of nested elements, and dark mode. By chaining modifiers onto your query, you can target complex combinations of elements, manage styles based on the presence of classes or ids, bulk style an element's children, and more.
