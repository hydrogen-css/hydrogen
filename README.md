# Hydrogen.css

Hydrogen is a utility-first styling tool for creating web interfaces without writing CSS.

It leverages data-attributes to allow the styling of elements right in your markup, rather than creating your own classes. Hydrogen offers a comprehensive library of tools and configurations for easy, seamless development. When you're ready to publish your project, it then processes your markup and creates a custom CSS file that contains only the code you've used, reducing its own footprint.
