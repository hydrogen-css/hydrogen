It has small implementation bugs regardless of the approach taken to generate a grid, so it's been simplified for ease-of-use.",
          "Because flexbox's support of gap is implemented differently than grid, the flex-grid relies on a negative margin hack to allow for gap/gutter support. This approach has its downsides though, specifically that applying backgrounds, padding, or borders directly to the grid element doesn't behave as expected and that the negative margin overlaps previous elements if it's large.",
          "These changes were implemented as the result of a bug with the current implementation relying on inline-flex over flex as the default grid display value. This gave the grid extra height if the grid items were smaller than the default line height of the tag used.",
          "It's now recommended that applying styles to a grid be done on a wrapper element instead, which avoids a significant number of implementation bugs. Thus, grid-padding has been removed as an option from the flex-grid attribute."
