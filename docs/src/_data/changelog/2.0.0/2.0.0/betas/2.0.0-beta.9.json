          "The cascade order was broken for pseudo-classes when an element with a dark modifier applied a light class.",
          "This was the result of the light class coming after the hover declaration in the cascade, making it take priority.",
          "To fix this, the media array was completely rewritten and restructured so that the output provided the expected behaviour of interactions like hover overwriting light mode styles.",
          "The array now outputs in the following order: standard attributes, light class attributes, dark class attributes, standard pseudo class attributes, light class pseudo class attributes, dark class pseudo class attributes, preference-based dark attributes, and finally preference-based dark pseudo class attributes."
